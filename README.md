# CAE AND CHELL PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE CONTRIBUTING TO CODE

Add notes here as well so the info doesn't get lost!

We're using Godot 4.0 and the game resolution is 960x540 (UI is at 1x scale but pixels are at 2x)

Keep to the folder structure and ask Froggo questions if you need clarifications! Froggo is really anal about code structure, so they will cry if they can't find something in code

- assets: all image and sound files
- addons: for plugins (don't mess with any files in here!)
- prefabs: for reuseable nodes not tied to a specific scene
- scenes: for setting up "screens" that the player will see, reference UI nodes here
- theme: for styled components like fonts and buttons and/or .tres files

If you download any plugins, please list the documentation below:
